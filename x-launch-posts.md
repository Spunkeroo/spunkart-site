## 1. LAUNCH THREAD (10 Tweets)

### Tweet 1 — Hook (appeals to EVERYONE)

I made 23 free online tools and I'm not charging a dime.

No signup. No email. No credit card. No catch.

Password generator, invoice maker, PDF tools, budget tracker, QR codes, scam checker, and 17 more.

Built solo with @AnthropicAI — here's the full list:

**Image description:** 1200x675. Dark (#0a0a0a) background. Large white text: "23 Free Tools. Zero Signup." Below in green (#10b981): "Invoices. PDFs. Passwords. Budgets. QR Codes. And more." Orange (#ff5f1f) accent line across the bottom. SpunkArt logo small bottom-right.

---

### Tweet 2 — The Problems They Solve

These tools solve real problems:

- Need an invoice? Free.
- Need a privacy policy? Free.
- Need to merge PDFs? Free.
- Need a strong password? Free.
- Need a QR code? Free.
- Need to check if a site is a scam? Free.

No app to download. No account to create. Works in your browser.

**Image description:** 1200x675. Dark background. Two-column layout: left side lists problems in white, right side shows "FREE" in green (#10b981) next to each. Orange (#ff5f1f) header: "Every tool. Every time. Free."

### Tweet 3 — Who These Are For

Who are these for?

- Freelancers who need invoices without paying for QuickBooks
- Small business owners who need a privacy policy without a lawyer
- Anyone who needs to compress images without uploading to a sketchy site
- Students managing their budget
- Job seekers building a professional email signature

If you use the internet, something here saves you time. @IndieHackers

### Tweet 4 — The Money-Saving Math

What people normally pay for these tools:

- Invoice generator: $15/mo (FreshBooks)
- PDF tools: $12/mo (Adobe)
- QR code generator: $12/mo (@Canva Pro)
- Privacy policy: $100+ (lawyer or generator)
- Image compression: $5/mo (TinyPNG Pro)
- Landing page copy: $29/mo (Jasper)

That's $800+/year.

SpunkArt: $0. Forever.

### Tweet 5 — Privacy and Trust

Every tool runs in your browser.

Your files never leave your device. Your data is never stored. There's no server upload. No tracking pixel. No analytics on your content.

I built these with @AnthropicAI the way I wish all free tools worked — actually free, actually private.

**SEO Tools:** #seo #googleranking #websitetips #blogging
**Security Tools:** #cybersecurity #onlinesafety #scamalert #protectyourmoney
**Design Tools:** #design #branding #webdesign #colorpalette
**Finance Tools:** #invoicing #budgeting #personalfinance #freelancerlife
**PDF/Productivity:** #officehacks #productivity #workflow

### Developer (Tertiary — Use Sparingly)
- #webdev #buildinpublic #cloudflare #programming #devtools

### Rules:
1. Every post gets 2-3 hashtags maximum (more looks spammy)
2. Always include at least ONE audience-specific hashtag
3. #freetools goes on almost everything
4. NEVER lead with dev hashtags unless the tool is dev-specific
5. Match hashtags to the target audience, not the tool category

---

### If Budget Allows ($5-20/day boosting)

Boost in this priority order:
1. **Growth Post 3** (Canva QR comparison) — shareable, not salesy
2. **Growth Post 7** (Things that should be free) — list format performs well in ads
3. **Scam Checker tool post** — broadest audience appeal
4. **Invoice Generator tool post** — high commercial intent
5. **Launch Thread Tweet 1** — top-of-funnel awareness

Target these audiences when boosting:
- Small business owners (interest: Shopify, Etsy, Square, QuickBooks)
- Freelancers (interest: Upwork, Fiverr, freelancing)
- Content creators (interest: Canva, Notion, content marketing)

---

### Cross-Post Strategy

**Every post links back to spunkart.com/spunk** (the mega referral link).

| Platform | Adapt For | Best Posts To Share |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| X (primary) | All content originates here | Everything |
| LinkedIn | Professional tone, longer text OK | Invoice, Email Signature, Privacy Policy, Referral |
| Reddit r/smallbusiness | Helpful, no hard sell, lead with free | Tool-specific when someone asks |
| Reddit r/freelance | Lead with free invoice/PDF tools | Invoice Generator, PDF Tools |
| Reddit r/Entrepreneur | Lead with Business Name Generator | Business tools, Privacy Policy |
| Facebook Groups | Small biz groups, freelancer groups | Free tool thread, comparison posts |
| TikTok/Reels | Quick screen recordings of tools | PDF merge, QR code, Scam Checker (most visual) |
| @ProductHunt | Launch as "23 Free Browser Tools" | Full collection |
| Hacker News | "Show HN: 23 free tools, no signup" | Link to spunkart.com/store#free-tools |

---

### Tracking

- UTM parameters on all shared links where possible
- Monitor referral signups and conversions weekly
- Track which tool posts get most engagement — those become your "hero" posts
- Track which reply templates get the most clicks
- Screenshot viral posts for repurposing
- Every Sunday: review analytics, adjust next week's schedule

| @IndieHackers | Community account — tag on "what are you building?" and tool threads |

| @NotionHQ | Talking about productivity tools, note-taking, organization |
| @stripe | Talking about payments/checkout, premium tool purchases |
| @gaborors | Shares business tools — tag on business tool posts |
| @aaborns | Shares entrepreneur content — tag on referral/business posts |

### DM Template 3 — Reddit Community Posts

> **Target:** r/webdev, r/SideProject, r/smallbusiness, r/Entrepreneur, r/Scams

**r/SideProject post:**

**Title:** I built 23 free browser tools — no signup, no account, no catch

I got tired of paying monthly subscriptions for basic tools, so I built free alternatives that run entirely in your browser.

**What's included:**
- Invoice Generator (free vs $15/mo FreshBooks)
- PDF Merge/Split/Compress (free vs $12/mo Adobe)
- QR Code Generator (free vs $12/mo Canva Pro)
- Privacy Policy Generator (free vs $100+ generators)
- Password Generator, Budget Tracker, Image Compressor, Scam Checker, and 15 more

**Technical details:**
- Everything runs client-side — your data never leaves your device
- No server uploads, no tracking, no analytics on your content
- Built as a solo developer using Claude (Anthropic) for AI features and Cloudflare Workers for premium tools

**Free tools:** spunkart.com/store#free-tools
**Premium tools (Cloudflare Workers):** $4.99 each or $19.99 for all 18 at spunkart.com/store

I'm not VC-funded. This is a solo operation. Feedback welcome.

---

**r/Scams post:**

**Title:** Free scam checker tool — check any website or wallet address before sending money

I built a free tool that checks websites and wallet addresses against known scam databases and community reports.

**How it works:**
- Enter any URL or crypto wallet address
- Gets checked against scam databases and community reports
- Shows a risk score with details
- Takes about 5 seconds

**Link:** scam.ink/scam-checker

No signup. No email. No app to download. Just paste and check.

I built this because I kept seeing people in this sub asking "is this legit?" — now there's a free way to check before you send money.

## 12. TODAY'S ACTION PLAN — GET FIRST SALES NOW

> **Date:** February 22, 2026
> **Goal:** First premium tool sales TODAY with near-zero followers
> **Time investment:** 4-6 focused hours
> **Expected results:** 500-2,000 impressions, 5-20 store visits, 1-3 sales

### Hour 1: Launch (10:00 AM EST)

**Step 1 — Post the launch thread NOW**
- Post all 10 tweets of the launch thread (Section 1) as a thread
- Pin Tweet 1 to your profile
- QRT Tweet 1 with: "23 free tools. No signup. No catch. Thread below."
- Make sure your bio says: "I build free tools. 23 and counting. spunkart.com/spunk"

**Step 2 — Immediately engage with 10 trending tweets**
- Search these hashtags: #buildinpublic #indiehackers #freetools #solofounder
- Find 10 tweets with 50+ likes from the last 24 hours
- Reply to each with a GENUINE comment + relevant tool link
- Example: Someone shares their project -> "This is great! I'm building something similar — 23 free browser tools at spunkart.com/store#free-tools. No signup needed."
- DO NOT copy-paste the same reply. Personalize each one.

### Hour 2: Reddit Blitz (11:00 AM EST)

**Step 3 — Post on Reddit (3 subreddits)**
- r/SideProject: Use DM Template 3 (r/SideProject version)
- r/webdev: Adapt with more technical details about client-side architecture
- r/Scams: Use DM Template 3 (r/Scams version) — THIS IS YOUR MOST VIRAL POST

**Step 4 — Comment on 5 existing Reddit threads**
- Search r/smallbusiness for "free tools" or "invoice" or "PDF"
- Search r/Entrepreneur for "starting a business" or "free resources"
- Leave helpful comments with your tool link where genuinely relevant
- Lead with value, not promotion

### Hour 3: Outreach (12:00 PM EST)

**Step 5 — DM 5 newsletter curators**
- Search X for: "free tools newsletter" "tool roundup" "indie tools"

- Use DM Template 1 — personalize the first line for each
- Accounts to prioritize:
  - @veraborns
  - @levaborns
  - @taborein
  - @swaborns
  - Any "free tools" thread poster with 5K+ followers

### Hour 4: Individual Tool Posts (1:00 PM EST)

**Step 6 — Post individual tool tweets (every 2 hours)**
- 1:00 PM: Scam Checker post (Tool 22) — broadest appeal
- 3:00 PM: Invoice Generator post (Tool 4) — highest commercial intent
- 5:00 PM: QR Code Generator post (Tool 6) — @Canva comparison
- 7:00 PM: PDF Tools post (Tool 2) — Adobe comparison
- 9:00 PM: Privacy Policy Generator post (Tool 8) — legal fear angle

### Hour 5: "Built a Free Alternative" Posts (3:00 PM EST)

**Step 7 — Post 2 "alternative" posts**
- Post Alt Post 1 (Canva QR) at 3:00 PM
- Post Alt Post 2 (Bitly) at 5:00 PM
- These get engagement from BOTH supporters AND people defending the brand — either way, impressions go up

### Hour 6: Cross-Platform (5:00 PM EST)

**Step 8 — LinkedIn thread**
- Rewrite the launch thread in LinkedIn's professional tone
- Post as a text-only post (no links in the main post — put link in first comment)
- Use format: "I built 23 free tools as a solo developer. Here's what I learned."
- Tag #freetools #entrepreneurship #solofounder #buildinpublic

**Step 9 — Quote-tweet any relevant content**
- Search for today's tweets about free tools, SaaS pricing, #buildinpublic

**Step 10 — Evening engagement sprint (8:00-9:00 PM EST)**
- Reply to every comment on your posts
- Search for more "free tools" or "best tools" tweets and reply with value
- Retweet your own launch thread with a new hook
- Post Growth Post 9 (Bookmark this) as a nightcap post

### Key Metrics to Track Today
- [ ] Launch thread impressions
- [ ] Store page visits (check analytics)
- [ ] Reddit post upvotes and comments
- [ ] DM response rate
- [ ] Number of referral link clicks
- [ ] Any sales (check Gumroad/payment processor)

### If No Sales by 6 PM — Emergency Tactics
1. **Drop the price:** Offer a flash sale — "First 10 buyers get 50% off any tool. Code: LAUNCH50"
2. **Post the math:** "I spent 6 months building this. The entire bundle is $19.99. That's $0.11 per day of development."
3. **Give one away:** "First person to RT this gets any premium tool free" — builds social proof
4. **Cross-post to Hacker News:** "Show HN: 23 free browser tools, no signup required"
