### Reply 1 — When someone asks for a free invoice tool

> "Anyone know a free invoice tool?"

I built one — no signup, no watermark, saves as PDF. Works in your browser.

spunkart.com/spunk — click Invoice Generator.

Follow @SpunkArt13 for more free tools.

---

### Reply 2 — When someone asks about password security

> "Need a good password manager" / "How do I make strong passwords?"

If you just need to make strong passwords: I built a free tool that works right in your browser. Nothing saved, nothing sent anywhere.

spunkart.com/spunk — click Password Generator.

For storing them, I'd still recommend Bitwarden. But for making them — this is instant.

---

### Reply 3 — When someone is starting a business

> "Starting a business, need a name" / "How do I pick a business name?"

I built a free business name tool — type in what your business does and get a list of name ideas in seconds.

spunkart.com/spunk

Also has a free privacy policy maker and email signature builder when you're ready for those.

---

### Reply 4 — When someone asks about privacy policies

> "Do I need a privacy policy?" / "Where do I get a privacy policy?"

Yes, legally you probably need one. Lawyers charge $500+. Other tools charge $100/year.

I built a free one. Answer a few questions about your site, get a complete privacy policy that covers everything.

spunkart.com/spunk — click Privacy Policy Generator.

---

### Reply 5 — When someone needs to merge/edit PDFs

> "How do I merge PDFs without paying for Adobe?"

I built free PDF tools — combine, split, and shrink. Works in your browser, files never leave your device. No watermark, no file limit.

spunkart.com/spunk — click PDF Tools.

No reason to pay $12/month for this.

---

### Reply 6 — When someone needs a QR code

> "Need a QR code for my business" / "Free QR code generator?"

I built a free one — makes QR codes for any link, text, or contact info. Download the image. No tracking hidden inside, never expires, no account needed.

spunkart.com/spunk — click QR Code Generator.

---

### Reply 7 — When someone is worried about a scam

> "Is this website legit?" / "Has anyone used [sketchy site]?"

Paste it into this free scam checker first. It checks if the site has been reported as a scam.

spunkart.com/spunk — click Scam Checker (or go to scam.ink/scam-checker)

Takes 5 seconds. Could save you a lot.

---

### Reply 8 — When someone complains about SaaS prices

> "Why does everything require a subscription now?"

I felt the same way so I built 23 free tools that work in your browser. No signup, no monthly fee, no account.

Invoices, PDFs, QR codes, passwords, image shrinking, privacy policies — all free. @marc_louvion

spunkart.com/spunk

---

### Reply 9 — When someone needs an email signature

> "How do I make a professional email signature?"

Free email signature tool — type in your name, title, company, and links. Copy it. Paste it into Gmail, Outlook, or Apple Mail.

spunkart.com/spunk — click Email Signature Generator.

Takes about 60 seconds.

---

### Reply 10 — When someone needs SEO help

> "How do I get my site on Google?" / "SEO basics?"

Start with these three free tools:

1. Meta Tag Generator — add the right info so Google knows what your pages are about
2. Sitemap Generator — give Google a map of all your pages
3. Robots.txt Generator — tell Google which pages to show

All free, no signup: spunkart.com/spunk

### Developer (Tertiary — Use Sparingly)

### Rules:
1. Every post gets 2-3 hashtags maximum (more looks spammy)
2. Always include at least ONE audience-specific hashtag
3. #freetools goes on almost everything
4. NEVER lead with dev hashtags unless the tool is dev-specific
5. Match hashtags to the target audience, not the tool category

### If Budget Allows ($5-20/day boosting)

Boost in this priority order:

3. **Scam Checker tool post** — broadest audience appeal
4. **Invoice Generator tool post** — high commercial intent
5. **Launch Thread Tweet 1** — top-of-funnel awareness

Target these audiences when boosting:
- Small business owners (interest: Shopify, Etsy, Square, QuickBooks)
- Freelancers (interest: Upwork, Fiverr, freelancing)
- Content creators (interest: Canva, Notion, content marketing)

---

### Cross-Post Strategy

**Every post links back to spunkart.com/spunk** (the mega referral link).

| Platform | Adapt For | Best Posts To Share |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|

---

- Every Sunday: review analytics, adjust next week's schedule

---

**Title:** I built 23 free browser tools — no signup, no account, no catch

I got tired of paying monthly fees for basic tools, so I built free versions that work right in your browser.

I built a free tool that checks websites and wallet addresses against known scam databases and community reports.

- Gets checked against scam databases and community reports
- Shows a risk score with details
- Takes about 5 seconds

**Link:** scam.ink/scam-checker

## 12. TODAY'S ACTION PLAN — GET FIRST SALES NOW

> **Date:** February 22, 2026
> **Goal:** First premium tool sales TODAY with near-zero followers
> **Time investment:** 4-6 focused hours
> **Expected results:** 500-2,000 impressions, 5-20 store visits, 1-3 sales

### Hour 1: Launch (10:00 AM EST)

**Step 1 — Post the launch thread NOW**

- Find 10 tweets with 50+ likes from the last 24 hours
- Reply to each with a GENUINE comment + relevant tool link
- Example: Someone shares their project -> "This is great! I'm building something similar — 23 free browser tools at spunkart.com/spunk. No signup needed."
- DO NOT copy-paste the same reply. Personalize each one.

### Hour 2: Reddit Blitz (11:00 AM EST)

**Step 3 — Post on Reddit (3 subreddits)**
- r/SideProject: Use DM Template 3 (r/SideProject version)
- r/webdev: Adapt with more technical details about client-side architecture
- r/Scams: Use DM Template 3 (r/Scams version) — THIS IS YOUR MOST VIRAL POST

**Step 4 — Comment on 5 existing Reddit threads**
- Search r/smallbusiness for "free tools" or "invoice" or "PDF"
- Search r/Entrepreneur for "starting a business" or "free resources"
- Leave helpful comments with your tool link where genuinely relevant
- Lead with value, not promotion

### Hour 3: Outreach (12:00 PM EST)

**Step 5 — DM 5 newsletter curators**
- Search X for: "free tools newsletter" "tool roundup" "indie tools"

- Accounts to prioritize:
  - @veraborns
  - @levaborns
  - @taborein
  - @swaborns
  - Any "free tools" thread poster with 5K+ followers

### Hour 4: Individual Tool Posts (1:00 PM EST)

**Step 6 — Post individual tool tweets (every 2 hours)**
- 1:00 PM: Scam Checker post (Tool 22) — broadest appeal
- 3:00 PM: Invoice Generator post (Tool 4) — highest commercial intent
- 5:00 PM: QR Code Generator post (Tool 6) — @Canva comparison
- 7:00 PM: PDF Tools post (Tool 2) — Adobe comparison
- 9:00 PM: Privacy Policy Generator post (Tool 8) — legal fear angle

### Hour 5: "Built a Free Alternative" Posts (3:00 PM EST)

**Step 7 — Post 2 "alternative" posts**
- Post Alt Post 1 (Canva QR) at 3:00 PM
- Post Alt Post 2 (Bitly) at 5:00 PM

### Hour 6: Cross-Platform (5:00 PM EST)

**Step 8 — LinkedIn thread**
- Rewrite the launch thread in LinkedIn's professional tone
- Post as a text-only post (no links in the main post — put link in first comment)

- Tag #freetools #entrepreneurship #solofounder #buildinpublic

**Step 9 — Quote-tweet any relevant content**

### Key Metrics to Track Today
- [ ] Launch thread impressions
- [ ] Store page visits (check analytics)
- [ ] Reddit post upvotes and comments
- [ ] DM response rate
- [ ] Number of referral link clicks
- [ ] Any sales (check Gumroad/payment processor)

### If No Sales by 6 PM — Emergency Tactics
1. **Drop the price:** Offer a flash sale — "First 10 buyers get 50% off any tool. Code: LAUNCH50"
2. **Post the math:** "I spent 6 months building this. The entire bundle is $19.99. That's $0.11 per day of development."
3. **Give one away:** "First person to RT this gets any premium tool free" — builds social proof
4. **Cross-post to Hacker News:** "Show HN: 23 free browser tools, no signup required"
