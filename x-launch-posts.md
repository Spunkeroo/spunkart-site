## 1. LAUNCH THREAD (10 Tweets)

### Tweet 1 — Hook

I built 50+ digital tools as a solo developer.

23 of them are completely free. No signup. No email. No catch.

Here's what I made and why I'm giving most of it away:

### Tweet 2 — The Free Tools

The 23 free tools:

- Password Generator
- PDF Tools (merge, split, compress)
- Budget Tracker
- Meta Tag Generator
- Color Palette Generator
- QR Code Generator
- HTTP Headers Checker
- JSON Formatter
- Robots.txt Generator
- Social Bio Generator
- Invoice Generator
- CSS Gradient Generator
- Sitemap Generator
- Email Signature Generator
- Favicon Generator
- Business Name Generator
- Markdown Editor
- Privacy Policy Generator
- Image Compressor
- Landing Page Copy Generator
- Uptime Monitor
- Scam Checker

All live. All free. Zero signup.

### Tweet 3 — The Premium Tools

The other 18 tools are Cloudflare Workers you deploy to your own account.

$4.99 each. Or $19.99 for all 18.

Not subscriptions. One-time purchases. You own the code. Deploy in 60 seconds.

Workers include: link shortener, redirect engine, A/B tester, analytics proxy, form handler, auth gateway, rate limiter, and more.

spunkart.com/store

### Tweet 4 — The Ebook

I also wrote the playbook on how I did it.

"How I Built 120+ Websites in 7 Days" — the exact process, tech stack, and systems I used to ship 120+ live sites across 7 networks.

Not theory. Every site is live right now.

$14.99 — spunkart.com/store

### Tweet 5 — Lifetime Deal

If you want everything:

- 23 free tools (yours already)
- 18 premium Cloudflare Workers
- The ebook
- Every future tool I build
- Every future update

$99.99. One time. Lifetime.

No renewals. No tiers. No upsells. Just everything, forever.

spunkart.com/store

### Tweet 6 — The Math

Competitors charge per tool, per month:

- Link shortener: $15/mo
- A/B testing: $30/mo
- Analytics: $20/mo
- Form handler: $15/mo
- Auth service: $25/mo
- Rate limiter: $25/mo

That's $130/month. $1,560/year.

SpunkArt: $19.99. One time. You own the code.

Same results. 99% cheaper. No vendor lock-in.

### Tweet 7 — Reseller Program

Buy any bundle. Rebrand it. Sell it as your own. Keep 100% of sales.

- Pro Reseller: $99 (18 Workers, rebrand rights)
- Empire Reseller: $199 (everything + ebook + future tools)

No revenue share. No monthly fees. No approval needed.

You're not an affiliate. You're the owner.

spunkart.com/reseller

### Tweet 8 — Referral Program

Don't want to resell? Just share.

Send people to spunkart.com/spunk

You earn 25% cash on every sale they make. Tracked automatically. Paid out directly.

No cap. No minimum. No expiry.

Someone buys the $99.99 lifetime deal from your link? You get $25 cash.

### Tweet 9 — Social Proof

These aren't demo tools. They power real infrastructure.

- 120+ live websites across 7 networks
- Every Cloudflare Worker battle-tested in production
- Every free tool built to solve problems I actually had

One developer. Real tools. All live.

### Cross-Post Strategy

**Every post links back to spunkart.com/spunk** (the mega referral link). This is the single tracking URL for all campaigns.

**Platform cross-posting:**
- X (primary) -> All posts originate here
- LinkedIn -> Repurpose product posts and the ebook post (professional audience, higher purchase intent)
- Reddit -> r/webdev, r/SideProject, r/Entrepreneur (adapt tone, no hard sell, lead with free tools)
- Hacker News -> "Show HN: 23 free dev tools, no signup" (link to spunkart.com/store#free-tools)
- Product Hunt -> Launch the free tools collection + Pro Bundle as a product
- Dev.to -> Write an article version of the launch thread
- IndieHackers -> Build-in-public post with revenue/traffic numbers

**Link hierarchy:**
1. Free tools discovery: spunkart.com/store#free-tools
2. Full store: spunkart.com/store
3. Referral tracking: spunkart.com/spunk (use this everywhere possible)
4. Reseller program: spunkart.com/reseller
5. Scam Checker (standalone): scam.ink/scam-checker

### Tracking

- UTM parameters on all shared links where possible
- Monitor referral program signups and conversions weekly
- Track which tool posts get the most engagement to prioritize in rotation
- Track which product posts convert best to double down on that messaging
- Screenshot and save all viral posts for future repurposing
