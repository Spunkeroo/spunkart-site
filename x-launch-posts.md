## 1. LAUNCH THREAD (10 Tweets)

### Tweet 1 — Hook (appeals to EVERYONE)

I made 23 free online tools and I'm not charging a dime.

No signup. No email. No credit card. No catch.

Password generator, invoice maker, PDF tools, budget tracker, QR codes, scam checker, and 17 more.

Here's the full list:

**Image description:** 1200x675. Dark (#0a0a0a) background. Large white text: "23 Free Tools. Zero Signup." Below in green (#10b981): "Invoices. PDFs. Passwords. Budgets. QR Codes. And more." Orange (#ff5f1f) accent line across the bottom. SpunkArt logo small bottom-right.

---

### Tweet 2 — The Problems They Solve

These tools solve real problems:

- Need an invoice? Free.
- Need a privacy policy? Free.
- Need to merge PDFs? Free.
- Need a strong password? Free.
- Need a QR code? Free.
- Need to check if a site is a scam? Free.

No app to download. No account to create. Works in your browser.

**Image description:** 1200x675. Dark background. Two-column layout: left side lists problems in white, right side shows "FREE" in green (#10b981) next to each. Orange (#ff5f1f) header: "Every tool. Every time. Free."

---

### Tweet 3 — Who These Are For

Who are these for?

- Freelancers who need invoices without paying for QuickBooks
- Small business owners who need a privacy policy without a lawyer
- Anyone who needs to compress images without uploading to a sketchy site
- Students managing their budget
- Job seekers building a professional email signature

If you use the internet, something here saves you time.

---

### Tweet 4 — The Money-Saving Math

What people normally pay for these tools:

- Invoice generator: $15/mo (FreshBooks)
- PDF tools: $12/mo (Adobe)
- QR code generator: $12/mo (QR Code Monkey Pro)
- Privacy policy: $100+ (lawyer or generator)
- Image compression: $5/mo (TinyPNG Pro)
- Landing page copy: $29/mo (Jasper)

That's $800+/year.

SpunkArt: $0. Forever.

---

### Tweet 5 — Privacy and Trust

Every tool runs in your browser.

Your files never leave your device. Your data is never stored. There's no server upload. No tracking pixel. No analytics on your content.

### Rules:
1. Every post gets 2-3 hashtags maximum (more looks spammy)
2. Always include at least ONE audience-specific hashtag
3. #freetools goes on almost everything
4. NEVER lead with dev hashtags unless the tool is dev-specific
5. Match hashtags to the target audience, not the tool category

### If Budget Allows ($5-20/day boosting)

Boost in this priority order:
1. **Growth Post 3** (Canva QR comparison) — shareable, not salesy
2. **Growth Post 7** (Things that should be free) — list format performs well in ads
3. **Scam Checker tool post** — broadest audience appeal
4. **Invoice Generator tool post** — high commercial intent
5. **Launch Thread Tweet 1** — top-of-funnel awareness

Target these audiences when boosting:
- Small business owners (interest: Shopify, Etsy, Square, QuickBooks)
- Freelancers (interest: Upwork, Fiverr, freelancing)
- Content creators (interest: Canva, Notion, content marketing)
